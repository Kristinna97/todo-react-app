ToDo React App


Live version:
https://todo-react-610b8a.netlify.app/

I build this app as a React exercise using React useState Hook. React keeps track of the list of todos and if you add a new one or delete existing one it updates momentarily.

You can only have  10 tasks at a time, and if you try add more than that that a notification will pop up to let you know that you need to delete an existing one. Once you delete an old task , you can add a new one.

There is also a option to delete all completed tasks which will delete all of the checked tasks.
